When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    First of all, when I have to work on some group project to let each person from the group 
    have an access. Also when you can't use your computer e.g. when it isn't work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	The repository of project you are working on might contain a lot of different branches
	each one of them could be developed by different person and represent different feature
	so you don't need to pull all this changes. You just need the ones that relates to your
	problem.
